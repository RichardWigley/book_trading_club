// Vertical Rhythm
//  - the spacing of blocks on the page can make for a calmer experience
//    for the reader. Going to try it out.
//  - placing all margins on the bottom which makes figuring out problems
//    easier. Don't have to worry about margin collapse, say.
//  - Needs to be as high up the require tree as possible - so other modules
//    can overwrite margin if they need
//
